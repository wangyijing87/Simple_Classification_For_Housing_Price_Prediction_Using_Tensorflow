# Simple Tensorflow Classification Problem

##Overview

In this case, We'll build a simple classifier for houses. The housing data contains features for each house like # of bathrooms, price, and area. We'll manually add labels to our data (whether buy (1) or not buy (0)) then given a new house, We use gradient descent as our optimization strategy.

##Dependencies
